# WaterMassAreaComputation
This repository stores the matlab scripts used to compute water mass area along A23, SR4 and A12 WOCE Hydrographic sections. The scripts were created by Dr. Povl Abrahamsen (BAS) and the results are published in Abrahamsen et al. 2019 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-019-0561-2).
Folder /A12/, /SR4/,/A23/ contains scripts named in the same style: calc_station_bathymetry.m compute the section distance and section depth along the rhumb line of the most complete occupation. calc_station_distance.m recalculate the station distance of each occupation along the pre-determined section line defined by the most complete occupation. calc_section_gamma_areas.m is the main script calls the cals_station_distance.m and calc_station_bathymetry.m to compute the water mass area using the neutral density ranges. The eos_legacy package is used to compute neutral density from in-situ temperature and salinity measurements.
grid_ctds.m reads CTD data, computes neutal density fields, and creats bin averaged profiles for further computation. 
extract_1m.m is called in calc_station_bathymetry.m function.
